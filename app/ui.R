##### Comments on Features used in the shinyapp ####

# Here's a brief overview of the key features I've included:

# 1. Image Upload (Salmon Picture): This adds a visual connection to the Pacific salmon, making the app more engaging and thematic.
   
# 2. Interactive Table: Users can filter the data by streams, species, and year ranges, which is useful for targeting specific interests. The option to download the filtered data adds practicality to the app, allowing users to take the information offline.

# 3. Bar Chart Plotting: Users can generate bar charts to visualize salmon count trends based on the stream and species they select. This is a great way to present time-series data in a clear and interactive way.

# 4. About Page: I've included a page with additional details, possibly about the app, the project, or related content. Adding symbols and formatting to this page can make it visually appealing and informative.
