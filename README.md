# Shiny App for Salmon Data Analysis

## Link to Running Shiny App
You can access the live version of the app at the following link:
https://linoja.shinyapps.io/my-first-shiny-app/

## Description of the App
This Shiny app allows users to explore and analyze salmon population data. The app provides interactive visualizations, including time series graphs, bar charts, and more, to help users understand the trends in salmon population counts over time and across different regions.

Key features:
- Interactive plots that display the observed salmon counts across different regions.
- Time series graphs to explore trends in salmon populations.
- Ability to filter data by region and species.
- The app allows users to explore the effects of different management practices on salmon populations and visualize the data in an easy-to-use interface.

Additionally, the app includes an image of a sockeye salmon located in the `www` folder. This image helps to relate the user to salmon.

## Dataset Source
The dataset used in this app comes from publicly available data on salmon populations in British Columbia. The data is provided by the **Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO)** .You can access the data directly from their official resources or find more information at the following links:
