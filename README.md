## Description of the App
This Shiny app 2.0  allows users to explore and analyze salmon population data in British Columbia. The app provides interactive visualizations, including time series graphs, bar charts, and detailed information about various salmon species to help users understand the trends in salmon population counts over time and across different regions.This is an improved version of the previous app.

Key features:
- Interactive plots displaying observed salmon counts across different regions.
- Time series graphs to explore trends in salmon populations.
- Ability to filter data by region, species, and year.
- Detailed species information, including descriptions and images, to help users better understand different types of salmon.
- The app enables users to explore the effects of different management practices on salmon populations, with easy-to-use interfaces and tools for deeper exploration.

New updates:
- The app now includes sections dedicated to specific salmon species (e.g., Coho, Pink, Sockeye), with detailed descriptions and images.
- Updated maps for salmon streams and their mouths in BC.
- Feedback option to user to send some suggestions/questions
